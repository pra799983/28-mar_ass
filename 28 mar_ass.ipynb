    "In Ridge regression, all predictor variables, including both continuous and categorical variables, need to be numeric. Therefore, categorical variables must be transformed into numeric form before applying Ridge regression. This process is known as categorical variable encoding.\n",

    "One-Hot Encoding: One-hot encoding is a widely used technique where each category of a categorical variable is represented by a binary (0 or 1) dummy variable. If a categorical variable has \"n\" unique categories, one-hot encoding creates \"n\" new binary variables, where each variable represents one category. These new binary variables can then be used as predictors in the Ridge regression model.\n",

    "Binary Encoding: Binary encoding is a technique that creates binary representations of the categories by assigning unique bit patterns to each category. Each bit position represents a different category, and the presence of a bit in a position indicates the occurrence of that category.\n",

    "Hash Encoding: Hash encoding is a dimensionality reduction technique that converts categories into a fixed number of numeric features using a hash function. The resulting numeric features capture the information of the original categories.\n",
